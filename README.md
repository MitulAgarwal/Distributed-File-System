# Distributed-File-System
Project based on distributed systems

The project allows a user to create, update, delete and list the files created on the server. The server then replicates these files on creation and keeps track of them using a global list. The main server makes sure that all the files are updated, created, and deleted across the network simultaneously, thus, the user can access and edit the documents even if one of the servers fails. ls. Thus, the project achieves many core Distributed Systems concepts like data replication, data transparency and some fault tolerance.
